    <p>The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines Superhero as “a fictional hero having extraordinary or superhuman powers”.</p>
    <p>This Superhero Technical Documentation has been written to give you, the reader, an incomplete guide to superheros. The technical documentation has been written with the goal of furthering your understanding of the more common aspects of the superhero
      archetype.

  <section class="main-section" id="history">
    <header>History</header>
    <p>Superheros have been part of the American entertainment lexicon since the early 1930s when they first made their appearances in newspapers and comic books across the country. These heros were often masked men and women who would use their incredible,
      although not necessarily supernatural, abilities to fight crime and better the communities in which they live. Building upon the foundations of masked avengers popularized in pop literature in the late 1800s and early 1900s, the stories of superheroes
      found in the golden era of print comics of the 1930s often had lessons about morality threaded into the crime fighter narrative. The tradition of principled stories teaching the reader some sort of lesson has continued to be a critical element of
      the superhero story as it has evolved and grew into the incredible popular genre it is today.</p>
    <p>As forms of media have evolved and expanded so has the format on which the superhero can be found. At first our often cape crusaders were found on print media such as newspaper comic strips and of course comic books. Following their print heyday,
      as the rise in the prevalence and accessibility to the AM radio in the common household grew, radio dramas were added. This was repeated across entertainment platforms with television and then movies and now, most recently, to video games and virtual
      or augmented reality experiences. The superhero archetype is more popular than ever and the mass merchandise and near exploitation of anything superhero related can be evidenced in countless occurrences in a simple trip to the mall or your favorite
      shopping websites.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="super_powers">
    <header>Super Powers</header>
    <p>Superheroes need some sort of extraordinariness to their character in order to separate them from the normalized reader and establish their superness. This specialness need not necessarily be supernatural in nature but must institute a sense of phenomenal
      being. For example, take Batman, an otherwise normal successful businessman who has used his incredible wealth to help him train and build awesome gadgets well beyond the scope of reach of the common reader.</p>
    <p>7 Common Superpowers (in no particular order)</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Flight</li>
      <li>Invisibility</li>
      <li>Super Strength</li>
      <li>Quick Healing</li>
      <li>Lazer Eyes</li>
      <li>Ultra-quick Reflexes</li>
      <li>Super Speed</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="costume">
    <header>Costume</header>
    <p>The costume is an essential part to establishing the identity of a superhero. The costumes color scheme, material, accessories, identifiers such as logos, and presence of a cape or no cape all are important factors in contributing to the feeling of
      a superhero. An exceptional costume will give an instant sense of who the hero is and if they are a morally positive (good) or negative (evil) character.</p>
    <p>Colors - The color scheme is perhaps the most important aspect of the hero's costume. Visually vibrant colors give the visual appearance of a good hero whereas darker more monochromatic color schemes are used to portray villains. When used correctly
      a good color scheme should be memorable and allow for numerous costume variations. Some of the best executed examples of color scheme use are found in Spiderman, The Flash, Batman, and Superman. These heros all use some sort of combination of red,
      blue, white, yellow, and black for their primary and secondary colors.</p>
    <p>Accessories - Accessories such as a mask, utility belt, or other clothing, gadgets, or tools are necessary for a satisfactory superhero costume. Every hero has some sort of costume accessory or gizmo to further develop their identity and establish
      how they fight crime. Some superheroes heavily depend on gadgets to fight and traverse their criminally infected terrain where in contrast others only rely on their superpowers and rarely use contraptions in their fights against evil.</p>
    <p>Identifiers - A striking and impactful logo is essential to a superb superhero personality. The logo should ideally identify both the superheros name and give observers some sort of idea about their primary superpower. The logo should be built on
      a minimum of two colors from the heros color palette but never use more than four. Common placements for the logo are on the hero's chest, back, and cape but placement on accessories such as an arm, wrist, or headband, or jacket are also acceptable.
      Note - Villans are mostly exempt from the logo requirement.</p>
    <p>Cape - The cape is the most controversial piece of the heros costume. While some heros rely upon their cape and use it as a primary tool others shun the cape and view it as a frivolous and unnecessary accessory. We will not debate the merits and drawbacks
      of the superhero cape here but it is vital that you be aware of the presence and existence of the superhero cape.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="sidekick">
    <header>Sidekick</header>
    <p>Sidekick - Sidekicks have been part of the hero's journey since long before the concepts of superheros were popularized by print media in the 1930s. Superhero sidekicks carry on a rich tradition of filling a more relateable subordinate role to the
      hero and in doing so they have taken on a sort of identity of their own. The superhero sidekick often has powers similar but lesser in comparison to that of the hero he follows and possesses their own costume, origin story, and shared nemesis -
      although their nemesis is often their hero's nemesis’s sidekick. A quick wit and strong yet occasionally meandering sense of morality guides the sidekick and often gets them into just enough trouble for the hero to help out and use the opportunity
      for growth and to teach an important lesson. In return the sidekick gives the hero a reassurance in their mission and helps rescue them when they fall into the intermiddent peril.</p>
    <p>A sidekicks name often follows a simple formula as seen below;</p>
    <code>1 Part Variation On The Heros They Follows Theme and/or +/- 1 Part Gender Identifier = 1 Part Superhero Sidekick Name</code>
    <p>For an example lets look at Batman and Robin;</p>
    <code>1 Part Flying Animal Theme Variation (Bat) - 1 Part Gender Identifier (Man) = Robin </code>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="orgin_story">
    <header>Orgin Story</header>
    <p>Superheros are usually developed and with a fairly simple recipe often with slight variations. The basic unmodified recipe is as follows;</p>
    <code>1 Part Normal Person + 1 Part Unexpected Event = 1 Spectacular Unexpected and Super Powered Result</code>
    <p>Of course many superheros do deviate from the recipe because variation is the spice of life and good writing.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="nemesis">
    <header>Nemesis</header>
    <p>The superhero exists to fight evil and therefore they must have evil to fight. Throughout the history of the superhero the hero's would fight the popular criminals of the time such as the mob in the 1930s, Nazis in the 1940s, and communists in the
      1950s and 60s. However the hero’s quest to eliminate the common criminal or enemy goon isn’t enough to keep us entertained and so the nemesis was introduced to the story. The nemesis’s sole purpose is to fight our hero. The nemesis may or may not
      have supernatural powers but should have extraordinary abilities similar in nature- but opposite - to that of our hero - often earning them the title of Super Villan. A well developed villain will also have their own powerful identity, costumes,
      origin story, and optionally has a hideout.</p>
    <p>Super Villains usually use a similar recipe with slight variation yet introduce an optional ingredient to the mix as seen here;
    </p>
    <code>1 Part Criminal or Bad Guy + 1 Part Unexpected Repercussions For Previous Mentioned Badness + (Optional) 1 Part Catallyst Action From The Hero = 1 Superpowered Evil-doer (Optional) Who Is Out To Get Our Hero</code>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="hideout">
    <header>Hideout</header>
    <p>The hideout is an important part of the superhero identity because it gives our hero a safe location where they can transform from their regular person into their superpowered alias and back. The hideout is a secure spot known to only the hero and
      those that they trust the most and also houses all the hero's gadgets, costumes, and vehicles. A good hero hideout is an extension of that hero’s personality and identity. For example - the Fortress Of Solitude is located in an remote spot on the
      polar ice caps - a symbol for Supermans feelings of isolation as the only super-man remaining from his planet.</p>
    <p>The formula for a good superhero hideout is as follows;</p>
    <code>1 Part Of Some Aspect Of The Heros Personality + 1 Part Location That Metaphorically Matches That Part Of The Heros Personality = 1 Part Superhero Hideout</code>
